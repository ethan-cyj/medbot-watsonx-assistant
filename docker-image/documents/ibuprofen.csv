What is ibuprofen?
"Ibuprofen is a type of anti-inflammatory pain-relief medicine that treats fever and mild to moderate pain caused by inflammation. It belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs."
How does ibuprofen work?
"Ibuprofen works on one of the body's chemical pathways for pain. It reduces your body's ability to make prostaglandins - these are the natural chemicals that trigger pain, inflammation and fever."
"With fewer prostaglandins in your body, pain and inflammation are reduced, and your fever goes down."
