DRUG INFORMATION: Methotrexate
Methotrexate
- Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug which helps to control over- activity of the immune system by interfering with some actively growing cells within the body.
- It is used for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), juvenile arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory myositis (muscle inflammation).
- In arthritis, Methotrexate acts as a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) to help to reduce pain, swelling and long-term joint damage.

How is Methotrexate Taken?
- A typical weekly dose of Methotrexate ranges from 7.5mg to 25mg, given in the form of tablets or injection. Dosage may vary depending on your
disease activity and response to the medicine.
- It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not chew or crush the tablets. Wash hands thoroughly after administration.
- Folic or folinic acid (also called folate) is often given with Methotrexate to reduce the risk of some side effects. It is usually taken a day before or
after Methotrexate unless advised otherwise by your doctor.
- The beneficial effects of Methotrexate will begin after 6 weeks and the full benefits may not be seen until after 12 weeks of treatment. Thus it is
important that you take your medication regularly, otherwise you may not benefit at all.
- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember if it is within 2 days from your scheduled dose. For example, your scheduled dose is on
Sunday, if you remember on Tuesday, take the dose on Tuesday and resume back to the Sunday schedule the next week. Skip the dose if 3 or
more days have lapsed since the missed dose. Do not double the dosage to make up for the missed dose.

Can Methotrexate Be Taken with Other Medications?
- Methotrexate can be taken with other medications such as corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other disease modifying agents.
- Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or rheumatology nurse clinician if you are taking other medications including over-the-counter medicines,
supplements or traditional/herbal remedies as they may interact with Methotrexate.
- Do not drink alcohol while on this medicine as it may increase the risk of liver toxicity associated with Methotrexate.
- Pneumococcal and influenza (flu) vaccinations are safe and may be given if required. Avoid live vaccines such as MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), OPV (oral polio vaccine), yellow fever or BCG (tuberculosis). Discuss with your doctor before receiving any vaccines.

What are the Important Side Effects of Methotrexate?

Are There Any Special Precautions That I Need to Take?
- Avoid crowded places and consumption of raw or undercooked food while on Methotrexate.
- For female patients, please inform your doctor if you intend to conceive or breastfeed. This is because Methotrexate can cause miscarriage and
serious birth defects, and should be avoided before conceiving and during pregnancy. Reliable contraceptive measures must be used to avoid unplanned pregnancy whilst taking methotrexate. Patients should also wait at least three months after stopping Methotrexate before trying for a
child. In addition, women are advised not to breastfeed as Methotrexate is excreted into the breast milk.
- For male patients who are considering to have children, please discuss with your primary rheumatologist regarding contraception when using methotrexate.
- If you develop high fever, sore throat or other infections, see a doctor early because Methotrexate may reduce your immune response and cause some infections to become more severe. The doctor whom you consult should be told that you are on Methotrexate.
What Monitoring Do I Require While I Am Taking Methotrexate?
